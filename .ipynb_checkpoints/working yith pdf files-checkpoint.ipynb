      "Introduction\n",
      "The ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the \n",
      "sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles.\n",
      "This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised \n",
      "of electrical, electronic and software components.\n",
      "Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of \n",
      "automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence \n",
      "that functional safety objectives are satisfied.\n",
      "With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic \n",
      "implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, \n",
      "these being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes \n",
      "guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes. \n",
      "To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:\n",
      "a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities \n",
      "to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and \n",
      "decommissioning;\n",
      "b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive \n",
      "Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];\n",
      "c) \n",
      "uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable \n",
      "residual risk;\n",
      "d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, \n",
      "validation and confirmation measures; and\n",
      "e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.\n",
      "The ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved \n",
      "through safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which \n",
      "safety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be \n",
      "considered.\n",
      "The achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such \n",
      "activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation \n",
      "and configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.\n",
      "Safety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work \n",
      "products. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and \n",
      "work products.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of \n",
      "standards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product \n",
      "development. Within the figure: \n",
      "— the shaded “V”s represent the interconnection among ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, \n",

      "— for motorcycles:\n",
      "— ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 supports ISO 26262-3;\n",
      "— ISO 26262-12:2018, Clauses 9 and 10 support ISO 26262-4; \n",

On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO ', ' Clause ', ' qualitative and quantitative safety analyses are performed at \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. ', ' V ± ', ' V. If the analysis focuses on the output of \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' the linear voltage regulator is to be considered a part and the bandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

An analogue \\ncomponent has therefore an inherent capability to tolerate a fault. These faults are safe faults.\\nEXAMPLE ', ' \\nA resistor is used to limit the current flowing through a specific branch.

Two methods can be considered to extract or obtain the distribution:\\n― \\nthe first method consists of using a failure rate per mm', ' \\nfailure rate or the whole hardware component failure rate (if not separated into package and \\ndie contributions) by the die area of the hardware component. The failure rate distribution is \\ndone by multiplying the part or subpart area related to the failure mode under analysis by the \\nfailure rate per mm', ' \\nthe second method is based on base failure rates and elementary subparts. This is done by \\nmaking an estimation of the number of equivalent gates (or number of transistors) for each \\npart, subpart or basic/elementary subpart related to the failure mode under analysis.\\n― \\nfailure rate distribution of the package. This can be derived only when the failure rate of the \\npackage is available. In such a case, for pins that are safety-related, the distribution of the failure \\nrate can be done using a failure rate per pin value which is obtained by dividing the package failure \\nrate by the total number of pins of the package (safety-related or not).\\nNOTE \\nThe selection of the method used can be based on the layout (or planned layout) of the circuit under \\nanalysis or on the analysis of how failure modes are shared between the hardware elements.\\n \\n', ' \\n© ISO ']\n",

Soft errors such as Single Event Upset (SEU) and Single Event Transient (SET), are defined \\nas transient faults (see ', ' \\nwhen shown to be relevant due, for instance, to the technology used and can be addressed either by a \\nquantitative approach, specifying and verifying a dedicated target “single-point fault metric” value to \\nthem or by a qualitative rationale based on the verification of the effectiveness of the internal safety \\nmechanisms implemented to cover these transient faults.\\nIn terrestrial analogue circuits, transient faults are caused by alpha-particle or neutron hits or by \\nelectromagnetic interference such as power transients and crosstalk. They can cause SEU or even SET \\nalso called Analogue Single Event Transients (ASETs), such as transient pulses in operational amplifiers, \\ncomparators or reference voltage circuits.\\nDue to the intrinsic nature of analogue technology (in which transient or noise effects are considered \\nby design), the susceptibility to transient faults is lower than in digital circuits by orders of magnitude. \\nTherefore, the analysis of those effects can be limited in a first approximation to their digital part \\n(e.g. the digital decimation filter of a sigma-delta ADC).\\nHowever in some cases, like in the early part of the conversion cycle of an ADC (see Reference [', ' \\nor in a PLL (see Reference [', ' \\nvulnerability to soft error can be high.

On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO ', ' \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. ', ' \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

For this \\nreason, those values are not comparable with FIT rates of a complete packaged digital component as shown for \\nexample in SN ', ' \\nThe aim of the following example is to avoid a requirement that each smallest digital component \\nsubpart be addressed in the system-level analysis. At system-level analysis, component or part level detail can \\nbe sufficient. The aim of this example is to provide evidence that for a digital component at stand-alone level, a \\ndeeper analysis (e.g. at subpart level) can be needed in order to compute with the required accuracy the failure \\nrates and failure mode coverage of parts and subparts, to be used afterwards by system engineers. In other \\nwords, without an accurate and detailed digital component stand-alone level analysis, it can be very difficult to \\nhave good data for system-level analysis.\\nThe following four safety mechanisms are considered:\\n― \\na hardware safety mechanism (SM', ' \\nCPU. This safety mechanism is able to detect with certain coverage the faults in the control logic \\nthat could cause the software to run out of sequence. However, this safety mechanism is poor at \\ndetecting faults (such as wrong arithmetic operations) leading to wrong data;\\nNOTE ', ' \\nIn this example, it is assumed that each detected permanent single bit fault affecting the CPU is \\nsignalled to the system (e.g. by activating an output signal of the digital component). As a consequence of \\nthis assumption, the failure mode coverage w.r.t. latent faults can be assumed ', ' \\nis described in ISO ', ' \\n(e.g. to enter a safe state and inform the driver). For suspect transient faults, the CPU can try to remove these \\nfaults by a reset. If the fault persists, it means it is permanent, and therefore it can be signalled to the system \\nas previously described. If the fault disappears (i.e. it was really transient), the CPU can continue.\\n― \\na software-based safety mechanism (SM', ' \\nCPU (SM', '\\n \\n', ' \\n© ISO ']\n",

On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO ', ' \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. ', ' \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO ', ' \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. ', ' \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

The sensitivity is \\nproportional to the total device capacitance, which \\nis the summation of each of the individual finger ca-\\npacitances.

Two methods can be considered to extract or obtain the distribution:\\n― \\nthe first method consists of using a failure rate per mm', ' \\nfailure rate or the whole hardware component failure rate (if not separated into package and \\ndie contributions) by the die area of the hardware component. The failure rate distribution is \\ndone by multiplying the part or subpart area related to the failure mode under analysis by the \\nfailure rate per mm', ' \\nthe second method is based on base failure rates and elementary subparts. This is done by \\nmaking an estimation of the number of equivalent gates (or number of transistors) for each \\npart, subpart or basic/elementary subpart related to the failure mode under analysis.\\n― \\nfailure rate distribution of the package. This can be derived only when the failure rate of the \\npackage is available. In such a case, for pins that are safety-related, the distribution of the failure \\nrate can be done using a failure rate per pin value which is obtained by dividing the package failure \\nrate by the total number of pins of the package (safety-related or not).\\nNOTE \\nThe selection of the method used can be based on the layout (or planned layout) of the circuit under \\nanalysis or on the analysis of how failure modes are shared between the hardware elements.\\n \\n', ' \\n© ISO ']\n",

However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

Soft errors such as Single Event Upset (SEU) and Single Event Transient (SET), are defined \\nas transient faults (see ', ' \\nwhen shown to be relevant due, for instance, to the technology used and can be addressed either by a \\nquantitative approach, specifying and verifying a dedicated target “single-point fault metric” value to \\nthem or by a qualitative rationale based on the verification of the effectiveness of the internal safety \\nmechanisms implemented to cover these transient faults.\\nIn terrestrial analogue circuits, transient faults are caused by alpha-particle or neutron hits or by \\nelectromagnetic interference such as power transients and crosstalk. They can cause SEU or even SET \\nalso called Analogue Single Event Transients (ASETs), such as transient pulses in operational amplifiers, \\ncomparators or reference voltage circuits.\\nDue to the intrinsic nature of analogue technology (in which transient or noise effects are considered \\nby design), the susceptibility to transient faults is lower than in digital circuits by orders of magnitude. \\nTherefore, the analysis of those effects can be limited in a first approximation to their digital part \\n(e.g. the digital decimation filter of a sigma-delta ADC).\\nHowever in some cases, like in the early part of the conversion cycle of an ADC (see Reference [', ' \\nor in a PLL (see Reference [', ' \\nvulnerability to soft error can be high.

On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO ', ' \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. ', ' \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin ', ' \\nsubparts.\\n', ' \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process.

For this \\nreason, those values are not comparable with FIT rates of a complete packaged digital component as shown for \\nexample in SN ', ' \\nThe aim of the following example is to avoid a requirement that each smallest digital component \\nsubpart be addressed in the system-level analysis. At system-level analysis, component or part level detail can \\nbe sufficient. The aim of this example is to provide evidence that for a digital component at stand-alone level, a \\ndeeper analysis (e.g. at subpart level) can be needed in order to compute with the required accuracy the failure \\nrates and failure mode coverage of parts and subparts, to be used afterwards by system engineers. In other \\nwords, without an accurate and detailed digital component stand-alone level analysis, it can be very difficult to \\nhave good data for system-level analysis.\\nThe following four safety mechanisms are considered:\\n― \\na hardware safety mechanism (SM', ' \\nCPU. This safety mechanism is able to detect with certain coverage the faults in the control logic \\nthat could cause the software to run out of sequence. However, this safety mechanism is poor at \\ndetecting faults (such as wrong arithmetic operations) leading to wrong data;\\nNOTE ', ' \\nIn this example, it is assumed that each detected permanent single bit fault affecting the CPU is \\nsignalled to the system (e.g. by activating an output signal of the digital component). As a consequence of \\nthis assumption, the failure mode coverage w.r.t. latent faults can be assumed ', ' \\nis described in ISO ', ' \\n(e.g. to enter a safe state and inform the driver). For suspect transient faults, the CPU can try to remove these \\nfaults by a reset. If the fault persists, it means it is permanent, and therefore it can be signalled to the system \\nas previously described. If the fault disappears (i.e. it was really transient), the CPU can continue.\\n― \\na software-based safety mechanism (SM', ' \\nCPU (SM', '\\n \\n', ' \\n© ISO ']\n",
