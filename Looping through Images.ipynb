      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nIntroduction\\nThe ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the \\nsector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles.\\nThis adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised \\nof electrical, electronic and software components.\\nSafety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of \\nautomotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence \\nthat functional safety objectives are satisfied.\\nWith the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic \\nimplementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, \\nthese being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes \\nguidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes. \\nTo achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:\\na) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities \\nto be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and \\ndecommissioning;\\nb) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive \\nSafety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];\\nc) \\nuses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable \\nresidual risk;\\nd) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, \\nvalidation and confirmation measures; and\\ne) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.\\nThe ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved \\nthrough safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which \\nsafety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be \\nconsidered.\\nThe achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such \\nactivities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation \\nand configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.\\nSafety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work \\nproducts. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and \\nwork products.\\nFigure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of \\nstandards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product \\ndevelopment.

It does not address hazards related to electric shock, \\nfire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar \\nhazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.\\nThis document describes a framework for functional safety to assist the development of safety-\\nrelated E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate functional safety activities \\ninto a company-specific development framework. Some requirements have a clear technical focus to \\nimplement functional safety into a product; others address the development process and can therefore \\nbe seen as process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization with respect \\nto functional safety.\\nThis document does not address the nominal performance of E/E systems.\\nThis document has an informative character only. It contains possible interpretations of other \\nparts of ISO 26262 with respect to semiconductor development.

Targets for diagnostic coverages \\nfor relevant failure modes to meet hardware architectural metrics and Probabilistic Metric for random \\nHardware Failures (PMHF) or Evaluation of Each Cause of safety goal violation (EEC) are allocated to \\nthe item: in this case, the semiconductor component is just one of the elements. As mentioned in the \\nEXAMPLE of ISO 26262-5:2018 [66], 8.2, to facilitate distributed developments, target values can be \\nassigned to the semiconductor component itself, by either deriving target values for the SPFM, LFM and \\nPMHF at the item level or applying EEC to the HW part level. The safety analysis of a semiconductor \\ncomponent is performed based on the requirements and recommendations defined in ISO 26262-5:2018, \\n7.4.3 and in ISO 26262-9:2018 [70], Clause 8.\\nNOTE \\nIf an element has not been developed in compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, the \\nrequirements in ISO 26262-8:2018 [69], Clause 13 can be considered.\\nThe semiconductor component can be developed as a SEooC, as described in ISO 26262-10 [61]. In this \\ncase, the development is done based on assumptions on the conditions of the semiconductor component \\nusage (Assumptions of Use or AoU, see 4.4), and then the assumptions are verified at the next higher \\nlevel of integration considering the semiconductor component requirements derived from the safety \\ngoals of the item in which the semiconductor component is to be used.\\nThe descriptions and methods in this part are provided assuming the semiconductor component is \\na SEooC, but the described methods (e.g. the method for failure rate computation of a semiconductor \\ncomponent) are still valid if the semiconductor component is not considered as an SEooC. When \\nthose methods are conducted considering the stand-alone semiconductor component, appropriate \\nassumptions are made. Sub-clause 4.4 describes how to adapt and verify those methods and assumptions \\nat the system or element level. At the stand-alone semiconductor component level, the requirements of \\nISO 26262-2 [63], ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6[67], ISO 26262-7[68], ISO 26262-8 and ISO 26262-9 (e.g. \\nrelated to safety analyses, dependent failure analysis, verification, etc.) can be applied.\\n4.2 Dividing a semiconductor component in parts\\nAs shown in Figure 2 and according to the definitions in ISO 26262-1:2018, 3.21, a semiconductor \\ncomponent can be divided into parts: the whole semiconductor hierarchy can be seen as a component, \\nthe second level of hierarchy (e.g. a CPU) as a part, the following levels of hierarchy (e.g. the CPU register \\nbank) as subparts, till the elementary subparts (its internal registers and the related logic).\\nNOTE \\nThe level of detail (e.g. whether to stop at part level or go down to subpart or elementary subpart \\nlevel) as also the definition of the elementary subpart (e.g. flip-flop, analogue transistor) can depend on the safety \\nconcept, the stage of the analysis and on the safety mechanisms used (inside the semiconductor component or at \\nthe system or element level).\\n \\n2 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

At the component stand-alone level, the diagnostic coverage was considered zero. At system level, \\nthe ADC is included in a closed-loop, and its faults are detected by a software-based consistency check. In \\nthis context, the diagnostic coverage of that subpart is increased due to the safety mechanism implemented \\nat system-level.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nthe diagnostic coverage computed at part or subpart level could have been calculated under certain \\nspecific assumptions (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssumptions of Use\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or AoU).\\nNOTE 4 \\nAt system level different safety mechanisms or failure masking can be present. This can be taken \\ninto consideration in safety analysis when a justification is possible.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nA semiconductor component includes a memory in which each single-error is corrected and \\nsignalled by the ECC to the CPU. At the component stand-alone level, it was assumed that a software driver \\nis implemented to handle this event.

The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIP integrator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is used in reference to the \\norganization responsible for integrating IP designs from one or more sources into a design with safety \\nrequirements. The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIP supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is used in reference to the organization responsible for designing \\nor developing the IP. The IP integrator and the IP supplier can be separate parties as well as the same \\ncompany or different organisations in the same company.\\nBased on the requirements in ISO 26262 series of standards, four possible approaches are identified \\nfor IP based designs. These approaches are shown in Figure 5. The IP integrator typically chooses \\nthe approach based on consideration of the information provided from the IP supplier as well as the \\nmaturity of the IP.\\nEXAMPLE \\nIf no supporting information is available from the IP supplier, possible approaches can be limited \\nto the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproven in use\\xe2\\x80\\x9d argument, if applicable. If the proven in use argument is not applicable, then the role of the \\nIP in the safety architecture is treated differently, e.g. using diverse redundancy to reduce risk of systematic and \\nrandom hardware failures.\\nFigure 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Possible approaches for using IP in safety-related designs\\nThe IP can be an existing design with a predefined set of features. In this case the IP integrator has \\nthe responsibility of identifying the set of features which are required to support the safety concept of \\nthe design. IP can also be designed based on an agreed set of safety requirements. In this case the IP \\nintegrator identifies the requirements for the IP which are necessary to support the safety concept of \\nthe design.\\nNOTE 1 \\nThe guidance in this sub-clause can be applied to newly developed IP, modified IP, and existing \\nunmodified IP.\\nNOTE 2 \\nA common approach is to assume the possible target usage as defined in ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.5.7. \\nThis option is described as SEooC in ISO 26262-10 [61]. Development of an SEooC relies on identification of \\nassumed use cases and safety requirements which are verified by the IP integrator.\\n4.5.1.2 \\nTypes of IP\\nCommonly used IP types are listed in Table 1. This is not an exhaustive list covering the possible IP \\ntypes. This document considers both the physical and the model representation types of IP as applied \\nto semiconductor designs.\\n \\n6 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

When \\nthe IP has no allocated safety requirements, no additional considerations are required for ISO 26262 \\nseries of standards unless identified during the safety analysis. In the case of coexistence of non-safety-\\nrelated IPs with safety-related elements, dependent failure(s) analysis is used to evaluate freedom from \\ninterference. For dependent failure analysis guidance, see ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 7 together with the \\nadditional guidance in 4.7 of this document.\\nIf one or more safety requirements are allocated to the IP, the requirements of ISO 26262 series of \\nstandards are applicable. In particular requirements of ISO 26262-2, ISO 26262-4 [65], ISO 26262-5, \\nISO 26262-8, and ISO 26262-9 are often tailored to apply to IP designs. The following text gives \\nguidance for IP with allocated safety requirements, and how to consider these requirements for IP with \\nand without integrated safety mechanisms.\\nSafety-related IPs can be further classified based on the integration of safety mechanisms. Two \\npossible cases are illustrated in Figure 6, with subfigure (a) illustrating IP which has integrated safety \\nmechanisms, and subfigure (b) illustrating IP which has no integrated safety mechanisms.\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n7\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

Alternatively, other measures by the IP integrator \\nto comply with safety requirements can be applied, such as additional safety mechanisms at integration \\nlevel. Safety mechanisms can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both. If \\nevidence of a compliant development is missing, ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 13 and ISO 26262-8:2018, \\nClause 14, can provide alternative means to argue compliance.\\nThe IP integrator is responsible for each integration and associated verification and testing activities \\nrelated to the allocated safety requirements and safety mechanisms, as applicable.\\nNOTE 6 \\nThe IP supplier is responsible for ensuring that the delivery complies with the specified properties and \\nfor avoidance of systematic faults in the generated IP.

      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nAn SEooC is developed based on assumptions of the intended functionality and use context which \\nincludes external interfaces. These assumptions are set up in a way that addresses a superset of \\ncomponents into which the SEooC can be integrated, so that the SEooC can be used later in multiple \\ndifferent designs. The validity of these assumptions is established in the context of the actual component \\nintegrating the SEooC. In that context, IP developed as an SEooC can often be configured to target a \\nnumber of different designs. Configuration can be done before synthesis, after synthesis, or by fuse, \\nlaser cut, flash, or any other programming. In that case, the IP supplier provides information on the IP \\nconfigurations which have been covered by testing and verification activities.\\nEXAMPLE \\nConfiguration options to determine bus width for interconnects, internal cache memory sizes, \\nnumber of interrupts, memory maps.\\nNOTE 1 \\nIP configuration differs from configuration data for software: therefore ISO 26262-6:2018, Annex C is \\nnot directly applicable to IPs.\\nNOTE 2 \\nThe IP integrator performs the necessary verification activities to guarantee the correctness of \\nthe generated IP; the necessary work products, as listed in following clauses, are made available; and the IP \\nintegrator verifies the correct integration of the IP in its context.\\n4.5.3.3 \\nIP designed in context\\nWhen developing IP in context, the IP supplier tailors the safety activities as described in \\nISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.5.1.

Therefore the base failure rate used in the context of ISO 26262 series of standards focuses \\non random hardware failures only. See also 4.6.1.3.\\nEach technique available for base failure rate estimation makes assumptions about the failure \\nmechanisms to be considered.

As semiconductor technology is rapidly evolving, it is difficult for published \\nrecognized industry sources for failure rates to keep pace with the state of the art, particularly for deep \\nsubmicron process technologies. Because of this, it is helpful to consider the publications of industry \\ngroups such as JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), International Roadmap for Devices \\nand Systems (IRDS), and the SEMATECH/ISMI Reliability Council to get a broad view of semiconductor \\nstate of the art.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nJEDEC publishes several documents which can be helpful in providing references to understand \\nspecific failure mechanisms and estimate failure rates:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nReference [16] summarises many different well understood and industry accepted failure mechanisms for \\nsilicon and packaging; it can also be used to provide a physics of failure mode for estimation of failure rates \\nfor the identified failure mechanisms;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nReference [53] provides guidance on developing a reliability evaluation methodology based on an \\napplication-specific use model (mission profile); and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nReference [17] summarises a number of transient fault mechanisms related to exposure to naturally \\noccurring radiation sources and provides guidance on how to experimentally derive failure rates for \\nsusceptibility to soft error.\\n4.6.1.2 \\nQuantitative target values and reliability prediction\\nQuantitative target values for the maximum probability of the violation of each safety goal at item \\nlevel due to random hardware failures (PMHF) are sometimes misunderstood as inputs for reliability \\nprediction. As stated in ISO 26262-5:2018, 9.4.2.2, NOTE 1, these quantitative target values do not \\nhave an absolute significance but are useful for comparing a new design with existing ones. They are \\nintended to make available design guidance and to make available evidence that the design complies \\nwith the safety goals. Therefore those values cannot be used \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in reliability prediction.\\n4.6.1.3 \\nDifference between systematic and random failures\\nISO 26262 series of standards makes a distinction between systematic and random failures. Most \\navailable techniques for base failure rate estimation are intended to provide reliability estimates \\nand make no such distinction. The result of such techniques can be excessively conservative due to \\ninclusion of factors which estimate systematic failures. For example, estimation techniques based on \\nobservations of field failures do not, in general, have appropriate sample size or observation quality \\nto differentiate between systematic and random failures. Similarly, models which include systematic \\ncapability as part of the base failure rate calculation can be challenging to use in the context of \\nISO 26262 series of standards (e.g. \\xcf\\x80pm and \\xcf\\x80process factors defined in Reference [9]).\\n4.6.1.4 \\nEffect of failure recovery mechanisms\\nA concern is the handling of diagnostics which can be used to enhance availability. This can lead to a \\nmix of base failure rate with diagnostics while the ISO 26262-5 requires separating them for the metrics \\ncomputation.\\nEXAMPLE \\nConsider a common SEC-DED (Single Error Correct-Dual Error Detect) ECC used in many state \\nof the art automotive functional safety electronics. A reported MTTF (mean time to failure) for an SRAM with \\nSEC-DED ECC cannot consider a fault which results in a correctable error \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thus mixing effects of base failure \\nrate and diagnostics, which is separated for calculation of ISO 26262-5 metrics.\\n \\n16 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n"

The DFA addresses those DFI, which are not addressable within \\nthe standard safety analysis, in a qualitative way.\\nEXAMPLE \\nInterfering elements have the capability to corrupt resources of other hardware elements as \\na consequence of a random hardware fault or systematic fault: e.g. a DMA (direct memory access peripheral) \\nwrites to a wrong address and silently corrupts safety-related data.\\nThe list of DFI also contains some typical safety measures used to address these. The necessary safety \\nmeasures can depend on the nature of the safety requirement.

The DFA complements the analysis by ensuring that the effectiveness of the safety \\nmechanisms is not affected by dependent failures initiators. As mentioned in ISO 26262-5:2018, 7.4.3, the \\nsafety analysis can first be used to support the specification of the hardware design and subsequently \\nfor the verification of the hardware design. The DFA can be applied during the specification of the \\nhardware design (e.g. to specify safety mechanisms for the shared elements that have been identified) \\nand also to verify that the assumptions taken during the specification are realised and reach the \\nintended effectiveness.\\n4.7.3 \\nDependent failure scenarios\\nIn Figure 20, Element A and Element B are elements that have the potential to fail due to an external \\nroot cause.

Additionally the \\nroot cause can be located inside the semiconductor element under consideration or located outside, \\npropagating into the semiconductor element through signal or power supply interfaces for instance.\\nFigure 20 refers to a coupling mechanism intended to characterise some exemplary properties of the \\ndisturbances created by a given root cause. Such properties can help to specify the mitigation measures \\nand also to define the adequate models that can be used to verify the effectiveness of the mitigation \\nmeasures (see 4.7.5.2). They are now introduced:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 coupling mechanism: this characterizes the means by which a root cause induces a disturbance. \\nKnown coupling mechanisms are:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 conductive coupling (electrical or thermal) that occurs when the coupling path between the \\nsource and the receiver is formed by direct contact with a conducting body, for example a \\ntransmission line, wire, cable, Printed-Circuit Board or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPCB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trace or metal enclosure; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 near field coupling that occurs where the source and receiver are separated by a short distance \\n(typically less than a wavelength). Strictly, \"Near field coupling\" can be of two kinds, electrical \\ninduction and magnetic induction. It is common to refer to electrical induction as capacitive \\ncoupling, and to magnetic induction as inductive coupling:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 capacitive coupling that occurs when a varying electrical field exists between two adjacent \\nconductors typically less than a wavelength apart, inducing a change in voltage across the \\ngap; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 inductive coupling or magnetic coupling that occurs when a varying magnetic field exists \\nbetween two conductors in close proximity, typically less than a wavelength apart, inducing \\na change in voltage along the receiving conductor.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 mechanical coupling occurs when mechanical force or stress is transferred from the source to \\nthe receiver via a physical medium.\\nEXAMPLE This can be relevant for MEMS, where a particular shock with a particular resonance and \\nwaveform might force the comb structures in an accelerometer to stick (also known as stiction). See \\n5.5.3.2 for more details.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nradiative coupling or electromagnetic coupling occurs when source and receiver are separated \\nby a large distance, typically more than a wavelength.

Element design is implemented in a process technology by following a sequence of \\nstandardised manufacturing processes (e.g. diffusion, oxide deposition, ion implantation, die assembly) \\neach of which typically has risk mitigation in place through methods such as process FMEA and \\ncontrol plans.

These fault models are for RAM but it can be shown that the same fault \\nmodels are also valid for embedded FLASH or NAND FLASH, even if caused by different phenomena (see References [48], \\n[49] and [50]).\\n5.1.4 \\nFailure modes of digital components\\nThis sub-clause gives an example how to characterize the failure modes of digital components based on \\ntheir functional specification.\\nAs example of classification, for any function of the element, the element failure can be modelled as:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfunction omission: function not delivered when needed (FM1);\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfunction commission: function executed when not needed (FM2);\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfunction timing: function delivered with incorrect timing (FM3); and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfunction value: function provides incorrect output (FM4).\\nThe failure mode can be adapted to any logical function. In the context of a safety analysis \\n(ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 8) the failure mode description is enhanced with a root cause effect analysis \\nto understand how the failure mode propagates to other parts or subparts.\\nIn general, the failure modes of an IP block can be described at different abstraction levels and based \\non different perspectives on the block's fault-free functionality and faulty behaviours. The selection of \\nthe failure mode set influences the feasibility, effort and confidence of a safety analysis. Criteria for a \\nreasonable and objective oriented definition of the failure mode set are:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfailure modes allow the mapping of underlying technology faults to failure modes, as described in 4.3;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfailure modes support the assessment of the diagnostic coverage of the applied safety \\nmechanisms; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfailure modes ideally are disjunctive, i.e. each of the originating faults ideally leads to only one \\nparticular failure mode.\\nNOTE \\nAt the proposed level of abstraction, failure modes can be caused by the same physical root cause.\\nEXAMPLE \\nFM3 (timing) and FM4 (value) can be caused by a stuck-at fault or a soft error affecting some \\ninner logic function. If FM3 and FM4 are controlled by different safety mechanisms with different diagnostic \\ncoverage capabilities the safety concept is more robust against failure mode distributions.\\nAnnex A provides an example on how to use digital failure modes for diagnostic coverage evaluation.\\n5.1.5\\t\\nExample\\tof\\tfailure\\tmode\\tdefinitions\\tfor\\tcommon\\tdigital\\tblocks\\nTable 30 contains exemplary, non-binding failure mode definitions for common IP blocks.\\n \\n62 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n\"\n",

See 4.8 and 5.1.10 for details. Fault injection is not the only method, and other \\napproaches are possible as described in 5.1.10.\\n5.1.7.2 \\nHow to consider transient faults of digital components\\n5.1.7.2.1 \\nFailure rate of transient fault\\nAs described in ISO 26262-5:2018, 8.4.7, NOTE 2, the transient faults are considered when shown to \\nbe relevant due, for instance, to the technology used. They can be addressed either by specifying and \\nverifying a dedicated target \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle-point fault metric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d value to them or by a qualitative rationale.\\nNOTE \\nA justification is given for the selected procedure.\\nWhen the quantitative approach is used, failure rates for transient faults of each part or subpart are \\ncomputed using the base failure rate for transient faults.\\nDue to the amount and density of memory elements in RAM memories, the resulting failure rates for \\ntransient faults can be significantly higher than those related to processing logic or other parts of a \\ndigital component. Therefore, as recommended in ISO 26262-5:2018, 8.4.7, NOTE 1 it can be helpful to \\ncompute a separate metric for RAM memories and for the other parts of the digital component.\\n5.1.7.2.2\\t\\nClassification\\tof\\ttransient\\tfault\\nFor transient faults, the amount of safe faults can be particularly relevant. To justify the estimated \\namount of safe transient faults, a rationale about the results and the assumptions used to derive them \\nis made available.\\nNOTE 1 \\nThe rationale can be derived from fault injection as described in 4.8 or arguments based on the circuit \\narchitecture or application.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nA fault in a register storing a safety-related constant (i.e. a value written only once but read \\nat each clock cycle and, if wrong, violating the safety goal) is never safe. If instead, for example, the register \\nis written every 10 ms but used for a safety-related calculation only once, 1 ms after it is written, a random \\ntransient fault in the register would result in 90 % safe faults because in the remaining 90 % of the clock cycles, a \\nfault in that register will not cause a violation of the safety goal.\\nNOTE 2 \\nAs described in ISO 26262-5:2018, 8.4.7, NOTE 2 transient faults can be addressed via a single-point \\nfault metric. Transient faults are not considered as far as latent faults are concerned. No failure mode coverage \\nfor latent faults is computed for transients because the root cause rapidly disappears (per definition of transient). \\nFurthermore, it is assumed that in the greatest majority of the cases, the effect will rapidly be removed, e.g. by \\na following power-down cycle removing the erroneous state of the flip-flop or memory cell that was changed by \\nthe transient fault, before a second fault can cause the occurrence of a multiple-point failure. In special cases, this \\nassumption could be invalid and additional measures can be necessary and addressed on a case by case basis.\\nNOTE 3 \\nTransient faults are contained within the affected subpart and do not spread inadvertently to other \\nsubparts if they are not logically connected.\\nNOTE 4 \\nSome of the coverage values of safety mechanisms defined in ISO 26262-5:2018, Annex D, Tables \\nD.3 to D.10, are valid for permanent faults only.

This is especially \\ntrue for digital circuits for which fault insertion testing of single-event upsets at the hardware level is \\nimpractical or even impossible for certain fault models. Therefore, fault injection using design models \\n(e.g. fault injection done at the gate-level netlist) is helpful to complete the verification step.\\nNOTE 1 \\nFault injection can be used both for permanent (e.g. stuck-at faults) and transient (e.g. single-event \\nupset) faults.\\nNOTE 2 \\nFault injection is just one of the possible methods for verification, and other approaches are possible.\\nFault injection utilizing design models can be successfully used to assist in verification of safe faults \\nand computation of their amount and failure mode coverage.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nInjecting faults and utilizing well-specified observation points to determine if the fault caused \\na measurable effect. Moreover, it can be used to assist the computation and to verify the values of failure mode \\ncoverage, i.e. injecting faults that were able to cause a measurable effect and determining if those faults were \\ndetected or controlled by the safety mechanisms within the maximum fault handling time interval.\\nThe confidence of the computation and verification with fault injection is evaluated with respect to:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nthe quality and completeness of the test-bench used to stimulate the circuit under test;\\nNOTE 2 \\nThe quality and completeness of a test-bench is measured in terms of its capability to activate the \\ncircuit under test.

On the other hand, in the case of a software-based \\nsafety mechanism addressing random hardware failures, it can be difficult with the N-detect technique to gain \\na high level of confidence in the pattern richness due to the possible change of the context between subsequent \\nexecutions of the test at run time.

Otherwise for addressing failures, the probability of \\ndetection is dependent on the number of ECC bits for random data returned (for example, address line \\nopen or address line shorted to another address line such that an average of the two cells is returned). \\nThe coverage will most likely be lower if the addressing error leads to a completely different cell \\nselected, it could even be 0% if no protection against address decoder faults is provided.\\nFor RAM cell write-enable failure, ECC can provide high coverage if the cell cannot be initialized. The \\ncoverage is 0 % if the write-enable failure affects the entire cell after it has been initialized.\\n5.1.13.2\\t Modified\\tchecksum\\nNOTE \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 32 of this document.\\nAim: To detect each single bit failure.\\nDescription: A checksum is created by a suitable algorithm which uses each of the words in a block of \\nmemory. The checksum can be stored as an additional word in ROM, or an additional word can be added \\nto the memory block to ensure that the checksum algorithm produces a predetermined value. In a later \\nmemory test, a checksum is created again using the same algorithm, and the result is compared with \\nthe stored or defined value. If a difference is found, a failure message is produced (see Reference [34]). \\nThe probability of a missed detection is 1/(2size of checksum) if a random result is returned. If certain \\ndata disturbances are more probable, some checksums can provide a better detection ratio than the \\none for random results.\\n5.1.13.3 Memory signature\\nNOTE 1 \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 32 of this document.\\nAim: To detect each one-bit failure and most multi-bit failures.\\nDescription: The contents of a memory block are compressed (using either hardware or software) \\ninto one or more bytes using, for example, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm. A typical \\nCRC algorithm treats the whole contents of the block as byte-serial or bit-serial data flow, on which \\na continuous polynomial division is carried out using a polynomial generator. The remainder of the \\ndivision represents the compressed memory contents \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignature\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the memory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and is \\nstored. The signature is computed once again in later tests and compared with one already stored. A \\nfailure message is produced if there is a difference.\\nCRCs are particularly effective in detecting burst errors. The effectiveness of the signature depends on \\nthe polynomial in relation to the block length of the information to be protected. The probability of a \\nmissed detection is 1/(2size of checksum) if a random result is returned (see Reference  [34]).\\nNOTE 2 \\nUse of an 8 bit CRC is not generally considered the state of the art for memory sizes above 4 k.\\n5.1.13.4 Block replication (for example double memory with hardware or software comparison)\\nNOTE \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 32 and Table 33 of this document.\\nAim: To detect each bit failure.\\nDescription: The address space is duplicated in two memories.

Dependent \\non memory subsystem design, storage of inverse data in one of the two memories can enhance \\ndiagnostic coverage. Coverage can be reduced if failure modes (such as common address lines, write-\\nenables) exist that are common to both blocks or if physical placement of memory cells makes logically \\ndistant cells physical neighbours.\\n5.1.13.5 RAM Pattern test\\nNOTE 1 \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 33 of this document.\\nAim: To detect predominantly static bit failures.\\nDescription: A bit pattern followed by the complement of that bit pattern is written into the cells \\nof memory.\\nRAM locations are generally tested individually. The cell content is stored and then all 0s are written \\nto the cell. The cell contents are then verified by a read back of the 0 values. The procedure is repeated \\nby writing all 1s to the cell and reading the contents back. If a transition failure from 1 to 0 is a failure \\nmode of concern, an additional write and read of 0s can be performed. Finally, the original contents of \\nthe cell are restored (see Reference [34], Section 4.2.1). The test is effective at detecting stuck-at and \\ntransition failures but cannot detect most soft errors, addressing faults and linked cell faults.\\nNOTE 2 \\nThe test is often implemented in the background with interrupt suppression during the test of each \\nindividual location.\\nNOTE 3 \\nBecause the implementation includes a read of a just written value, optimizing compilers have a \\ntendency to optimize out the test. If an optimizing compiler is used, good design practice is to verify the test code \\nby an assembler-level code inspection.\\nNOTE 4 \\nSome RAMs can fail such that the last memory access operation is echoed back as a read. If this is a \\nplausible failure mode, the diagnostic can test two locations together, first writing a 0 to one location and then a \\n1 to the next and then verifying a 0 is read from the first location.\\n5.1.13.6 Parity bit\\nNOTE \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 32 and Table 33 of this document.\\nAim: To detect a single corrupted bit or an odd number of corrupted bit failures in a word (typically \\n8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits or 128 bits).\\nDescription: Every word of the memory is extended by one bit (the parity bit) which completes each \\nword to an even or odd number of logical 1s. The parity of the data word is checked each time it is read. \\nIf the wrong number of 1s is found, a failure message is produced. The choice of even or odd parity \\nought to be made such that, whichever of the zero word (nothing but 0s) or the one word (nothing but \\n1s) is the more unfavourable in the event of a failure, then that word is not a valid code.\\nParity can also be used to detect addressing failure, when the parity is calculated for the concatenation \\nof the data word and its address. Otherwise, for addressing failures, there is a 50 % probability of \\ndetection for random data returned (for example, address line open or address line shortened to another \\naddress line such that an average of the two cells is returned). The coverage is 0 % if the addressing \\nerror leads to a completely different cell selected.\\nFor RAM cell write-enable failure, parity can detect 50 % of failures if the cell is unable to be initialized. \\nThe coverage is 0 % if the write-enable failure affects the entire cell after it has been initialized.\\n5.1.13.7 RAM March test\\nNOTE 1 \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 33 of this document.\\nAim: To detect predominantly persistent bit failures, bit transition failures, addressing failures and \\nlinked cell failures.\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n79\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

For example, \\nan operation can consist of writing a 0 into a cell, writing a 1 into a cell, reading an expected 0 from \\na cell, and reading an expected 1 from a cell. A failure is detected if the expected \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not read. The \\ncoverage level for linked cells depends on the write/read order.\\nReference [34], Chapter 4, lists a number of different March tests designed to detect various RAM \\nfailure modes: stuck-at faults, transition faults (inability to transition from a one to a zero or a zero to \\na one but not both), address faults and linked cell faults. These types of tests are not effective for soft \\nerror detection.\\nNOTE 2 \\nThese tests can usually only be run at initialization or shutdown.\\n5.1.13.8 Running checksum/CRC\\nNOTE \\nThis technique/measure is referenced in Table 33 of this document.\\nAim: To detect single bit, and some multiple bit, failures in RAM.\\nDescription: A checksum/CRC is created by a suitable algorithm which uses each of the words in a \\nblock of memory. The checksum is stored as an additional word in RAM. As the memory block is \\nupdated, the RAM checksum/CRC is also updated by removing the old data value and adding in the new \\ndata value to be stored to the memory location. Periodically, a checksum/CRC is calculated for the data \\nblock and compared to the stored checksum/CRC. If a difference is found, a failure message is produced. \\nThe probability of a missed detection is 1/(2size of checksum/CRC) if a random result is returned. DC can \\nbe reduced as memory size increases.\\n5.2 Analogue/mixed signal components\\n5.2.1 \\nAbout analogue and mixed signal components\\nAs described in 4.2, a semiconductor component is structured in parts and subparts. If the signals that \\nare handled in an element (component, part or subpart) are not limited to digital states, this element \\nis seen as an analogue element. This is the case for each measurement interface to the physical world, \\nincluding sensors, actuator outputs, and power supplies.\\nFor analogue components, each element is analogue and no digital element is included. Mixed signal \\ncomponents consist of at least one analogue element and one digital element. Since analogue and \\ndigital elements require different methodologies and tooling for design, layout, verification and testing, \\nit is recommended to clearly divide the analogue and digital blocks. This can result in a variety of \\nconfigurations ranging from components that are primarily analogue but have digital support blocks \\n(e.g. digitally configurable voltage regulators or auto zeroing amplifiers) to components such as \\nmicrocontrollers that have only a few mixed signal peripherals (e.g. analogue to digital converters and \\nphase locked loops).

The boundary of an analogue element can be defined by its function and its associated \\nfault models and failure modes. Additionally, each element that has freedom from interference or \\nindependence requirements (e.g. redundant paths or functions and corresponding diagnostic functions) \\nis separated by part or subpart boundaries.\\nAdditional criteria can also be considered when dividing a mixed signal element (component or part) \\ninto sub elements (part or subpart):\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nsignal flow;\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nMixed signal control loops can consist of feedback ADC, digital regulator and output driver.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nconnectivity;\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nReference and bias circuits can serve multiple analogue blocks and oscillators can serve \\nmultiple digital or mixed signal blocks.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\ndifferent technologies;\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nHV switch is a DMOS transistor while the gate driver can use conventional MOS devices.\\nNOTE \\nOne benefit for a separation of these parts is that they can have failure rates with different orders \\nof magnitude or different fault models.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\ndifferent supply domains; and\\nEXAMPLE 4 \\nFeedback DAC can have different supplies than the other mixed signal block output driver.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nother criteria for partitioning.\\nEXAMPLE 5 \\nFrequency partitioning, such as high frequency versus low frequency subparts.\\nThe level of detail of the analysis is determined by the relevant safety requirements, safety mechanisms \\nand the need to provide evidence of independence of safety mechanisms.

The failure mode distribution depends \\non the hardware element implementation.\\nNOTE 1 \\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimplementation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is intended both the actual circuit design and the targeted process used.\\nThe classification of a failure mode depends on the functional and safety requirements allocated to the \\nsystem integrating the element. Based on the integration, a specific failure mode can or cannot lead to \\na violation of a safety requirement. Table 36 identifies possible failure modes that can be of concern for \\nan analogue and mixed signal part or subpart. The table can be used to extend the list of failure modes \\nreported in ISO 26262-5:2018, Annex D.\\nThe failure modes identified in Table 36 as well as the mentioned parts and subparts, are a general \\nreference and can be adjusted on a case by case basis. Failure modes for analogue circuits can be \\nderived by applying key words as mentioned in 4.3.2.\\nThe actual failure mode list used in a specific project can be adjusted (adding or removing failure \\nmodes) based on the specific implementation details or on the level of granularity deemed necessary \\nfor the analysis.\\nIt is noted that the relevance of the failure modes, including but not limited to those listed in Table 36 is \\ndependent on the context of the function to be analysed.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nThe obvious failure modes of a voltage regulator are over-voltage and under-voltage. These \\nfailure modes can be detected by an over voltage and under voltage (OV/UV) monitor as described in 5.2.4.2.\\nBesides the obvious failure modes reported in the above example, it is important to identify each \\nrelevant failure mode in order to perform a complete and thorough analysis.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nIf a voltage regulator is used as a sensor supply or as an ADC reference supply, then the failure \\nmodes affecting the stability and the accuracy of the output voltage, even within the OV/UV thresholds, can be \\ncritical. Output voltage with insufficient accuracy and output voltage oscillation within the OV/UV thresholds \\ncan be mitigated by using appropriate measures. An independent ADC (internal or external) can be used to \\nperiodically measure the regulator output voltage with the required accuracy to detect those failure modes.\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nIf a voltage regulator is used as a supply for a radio frequency (RF) module which has tight supply \\nvoltage ripple requirements, the prevention of fluctuation on the regulated output voltage caused by input \\nvoltage variations is an important feature, i.e. the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). Failure modes like output \\nvoltage oscillation within the OV/UV (i.e. ripple) limits and spikes affecting the regulated voltage can be relevant. \\nA low pass filter as described in 5.2.4.8 can be used to mitigate these failures.\\nEXAMPLE 4 \\nIf a voltage regulator used as an MCU core supply is sensitive to output voltage drops during start-\\nup (power-up) due to in-rush current exceeding regulator load current and/or current limit, a too fast start-up \\ntime can be critical. A proper regulator soft-start function can be used to mitigate such failure.\\nIf failure modes are classified as not safety-related, a rationale is to be provided in the safety analysis to \\nsupport the classification.\\nGiven the variety of implementations, Table 36 does not give any indication about the quantitative \\nimpact of the listed failure modes, i.e. the failure mode distribution. It is the responsibility of the \\nsemiconductor supplier to provide such quantitative data. An example is given in 5.2.3.3.\\nNOTE 2 \\nEven though it is known that a single physical root cause can lead to more than one failure mode, it is \\nreasonable to assume that the sum of the distribution of each failure mode is 100 % which is a prerequisite for \\nthe quantitative analysis.\\n \\n82 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

Soft errors such as Single Event Upset (SEU) and Single Event Transient (SET), are defined \\nas transient faults (see 5.1.2). ISO 26262-5:2018, 8.4.7 states that transient faults are considered \\nwhen shown to be relevant due, for instance, to the technology used and can be addressed either by a \\nquantitative approach, specifying and verifying a dedicated target \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle-point fault metric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d value to \\nthem or by a qualitative rationale based on the verification of the effectiveness of the internal safety \\nmechanisms implemented to cover these transient faults.\\nIn terrestrial analogue circuits, transient faults are caused by alpha-particle or neutron hits or by \\nelectromagnetic interference such as power transients and crosstalk. They can cause SEU or even SET \\nalso called Analogue Single Event Transients (ASETs), such as transient pulses in operational amplifiers, \\ncomparators or reference voltage circuits.\\nDue to the intrinsic nature of analogue technology (in which transient or noise effects are considered \\nby design), the susceptibility to transient faults is lower than in digital circuits by orders of magnitude. \\nTherefore, the analysis of those effects can be limited in a first approximation to their digital part \\n(e.g. the digital decimation filter of a sigma-delta ADC).\\nHowever in some cases, like in the early part of the conversion cycle of an ADC (see Reference [28]) \\nor in a PLL (see Reference [20]) or differential switched-capacitor circuits (see Reference [10]), the \\nvulnerability to soft error can be high. In those cases, more detailed analyses are done and appropriate \\ncountermeasures are identified (see Reference [1]).\\n \\nTable 36 (continued)\\n90 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nFor mixed signal components, the impact of soft errors in the digital part is considered as described in \\n5.1.7.2.\\nNOTE \\nSoft Error Rate evaluation by irradiation tests in analogue circuits is not a simple task. In this case \\nmeasurement is done mainly by more detailed analyses of the analogue part.\\n5.2.3 \\nNotes about safety analysis\\n5.2.3.1 \\nGeneral\\nThe examples and guidelines given in 5.1 can be valid for an analogue or mixed signal component. The \\nfollowing clauses describe some of the topics that can require additional clarification for an analogue or \\nmixed signal component.\\n5.2.3.2 \\nLevel of granularity of analysis\\nOne of the key aspects for the safety analysis of analogue elements is the proper identification of the \\ngranularity of the analysis. On one hand, a lower level of granularity is beneficial as it allows for a \\nbetter understanding of the failure modes and failure mode distributions. On the other, a higher level \\nof granularity allows for a clear allocation of safety mechanisms. Analogue elements are often used \\nto interface with physical objects making it useful to also consider mechanical characteristics and \\ndifferentiate the failure modes accordingly.\\nAs seen in ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 8, qualitative and quantitative safety analyses are performed at \\nthe appropriate level of abstraction during the concept and product development phases. The level of \\nabstraction can be consequently adjusted depending on the target of the analysis. Qualitative analysis \\nis more suited to identify failure modes while quantitative analysis quantifies their failure rates and \\ndistributions.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA linear voltage regulator is monitored using a windowed voltage monitor. The voltage monitor \\nis at the output of the regulator and is able to detect over-voltage conditions. If the output value moves outside \\nof a defined tolerance it is to be considered faulty e.g. 1,2 V \\xc2\\xb1 0,12 V. If the analysis focuses on the output of \\nthe regulator it can be relatively easy to discriminate between types of failures (e.g. safe because it fails within \\nthe allowed range, safety related because of over or under voltage) and quantify the protection offered by the \\nvoltage monitor. However, it is difficult to quantify the likelihood of each type of failure as required for metric \\ncomputation. If the analysis goes inside the regulator and focuses, for instance, on faults of the bandgap it is easier \\nto analyse propagation and likelihood of each failure of the regulator but not simple to quantify the protection \\nthat the external voltage monitor offers on the bandgap itself.\\nFor the safety analysis, the type of safety mechanisms can drive the selection of the level of granularity. If \\nthe safety mechanisms addressing analogue features are located at system or element level, descending \\nin the component hierarchy can lead to an overly complex analysis. The quantification of the failure \\nmode distribution can require an investigation of higher granularity. For instance, applying an equal \\ndistribution to the failure modes of the linear voltage regulator can give less accurate results than \\napplying an equal distribution to the blocks composing the linear voltage regulator as, for instance, the \\nbandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. With respect to terminology, in line with the classification described \\nin 4.2, the linear voltage regulator is to be considered a part and the bandgap, the buffer, the driver, etc. \\nsubparts.\\n5.2.3.3 \\nDeriving failure mode distributions for analogue components\\nThe failure distributions for analogue components are dependent on the circuit implementation and \\ntargeted process. Each supplier provides details on the failure mode distributions to be used in the \\nanalysis.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nA uniform failure mode distribution can be used for the initial analysis, e.g. if five failure modes \\nare defined, each failure mode is allocated 20 % distribution. The uniform failure mode distribution is considered \\nin the example in 5.2.3.5.\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n91\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nA more detailed distribution for each failure mode can be considered based on area; if the area of \\nthe circuit or circuits identified as the root cause for the defined failure mode is 5 %, then the allocated failure \\nmode distribution is 5 %.\\nApplicable failure modes and the level of detail of the failure mode distributions are justified according \\nto the circuit implementation and its physical area and documented accordingly.\\n5.2.3.4 \\nAbout safe faults\\nISO 26262-10 [61] states that safe faults can be faults of one of two categories:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nall n point faults with n > 2, unless the safety concept shows them to be a relevant contributor to a \\nsafety requirement, or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nfaults that will not contribute to the violation of a safety requirement.\\nAnalogue components are characterized by continuous signal regions and as such, tolerances are taken \\ninto consideration when used in systems. The tolerances on analogue functions as specified as part of \\nthe safety requirements allocated to that analogue component can be less constrained than the actual \\ntolerance of the analogue component itself. For this reason, the fraction of the failure mode that leads \\nto parametric failure or drift, but which remains within these tolerance ranges is safe. An analogue \\ncomponent has therefore an inherent capability to tolerate a fault. These faults are safe faults.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nA resistor is used to limit the current flowing through a specific branch. A failure in the accuracy of \\nthe resistor increasing its value (e.g. of 50 %) but not preventing the current limiting function would be a safe fault.\\nA specific fault in an element can have a different classification depending on the specific safety \\nrequirement considered. For more details see ISO 26262-5.\\nDepending on the system configuration and the safety requirements some failure modes are not \\nrelevant, i.e. they cannot violate the requirements. In this case, these failure modes can be classified as \\nsafe: They contribute to the hardware safety metrics increasing the failure rate of safe faults.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nAn output driver can have an output slope control to limit the rise and fall times of the output \\nvalue for EMI purposes. If the slew rate is irrelevant for the violation of the safety goal, failures in this slope \\ncontrol would be safe faults.\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nIf a voltage regulator is used to supply digital circuits only, failure modes affecting the stability \\nand the accuracy of the output voltage within the OV/UV thresholds can be classified as safe.\\n5.2.3.5 \\nExample of quantitative analysis for an analogue component\\nA detailed example of quantitative analysis for analogue components is described in Annex D.\\n5.2.3.6 \\nDependent failures analysis\\nAs noted in ISO 26262-9:2018, 7.4.2, NOTE, the analysis of dependent failures is performed on a \\nqualitative basis because no general and sufficiently reliable method exists for quantifying such \\nfailures.\\nThe steps reported in 4.7 are applicable also for analogue and mixed signal components. In the \\ndependent failures analysis, there are aspects that can be clearly considered when addressing analogue \\ncomponents, parts or subparts.\\nAnalogue circuits are by nature sensitive to noise and interference among different blocks or functions. \\nFor this reason, structures to guarantee sufficient independence by means of isolation and separation \\n(e.g. by implementing barriers and/or guard-rings or placing circuits at certain distances or separating \\nthe power supply distribution and even the ground layer) are implemented for functional reasons. \\nIn fact, substrate, power supply and global signals like bias, clock or reset are often considered as a \\nsource of interference and special care is taken to reduce such effect. This good design practice, usually \\nfollowed for functional reasons, provides benefits in terms of dependent failures avoidance.\\n \\n92 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nAnalogue circuits can be very sensitive to process variation resulting in mismatches in the device \\nbehaviour. To ensure the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csame\\xe2\\x80\\x9d transfer function of two blocks, as in the case of redundant parts, the \\nsymmetry of the design and physical layout is a key factor. In such cases, special attention is taken to \\nensure exactly the same layout of the two blocks including orientation, symmetrical placing, routing \\netc.; therefore diversity is not always a viable solution to improve the common cause failure avoidance \\nfor analogue circuits.\\nAs a consequence of these aspects, the dependent failures initiators are often addressed by techniques \\nensuring isolation or separation instead of with techniques aiming to differentiate their effects.\\nIn other cases, diversity can still be a valid technique to achieve the detection or avoidance of dependent \\nfailures. For instance, in a dual channel approach, using two diverse ADC architectures (e.g. successive \\napproximation ADC and sigma delta ADC) can reduce significantly the probability of common cause \\nfailures.\\n5.2.3.7\\t\\nVerification\\tof\\tthe\\tarchitectural\\tmetrics\\tcomputation\\nThis sub-clause is addressing a specific part of the safety analysis verification: the verification of the \\narchitectural hardware safety metrics and in particular the fraction of safe faults and the failure mode \\ncoverage.\\nPossible approaches include:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nexpert judgment founded on an engineering approach given that any data, either qualitative or \\nquantitative, is supported by rationale and relevant arguments, and is documented accordingly;\\nNOTE 1 \\nIn some cases, such arguments can be derived from the functional characterization of the hardware \\nelements responsible for the claimed parameters. The aim of the functional characterization is the systematic \\nfailure avoidance and not the hardware random failure but, in some cases, it can be used as evidence to prove the \\nlevel of coverage with respect to a specific failure mode: This is the case in which the aim of a safety mechanism \\nis to detect 100 % of one of more failure modes and this capability is guaranteed by design.\\nEXAMPLE 1     A voltage monitor as described in 5.2.4.2 is a typical safety mechanism used to detect \\novervoltage and under-voltage failure modes affecting the voltage regulator. If, during the hardware \\ndesign verification, the functional characterization of the voltage monitor shows that:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95     any event leading to a regulated voltage outside the expected range defined in the specifica-\\ntion for enough time to make the supplied hardware circuit malfunction is detected by the voltage \\nmonitor; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95     any event leading to a variation of the regulated voltage inside the range defined in the speci-\\nfication for any time does not affect the correct behaviour of the hardware circuit supplied by the \\nregulator;\\nthen, such characterizations can be used as arguments to claim a detection equal to 100 % of the \\nmentioned failure modes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nas mentioned in 4.8, fault injection simulation during the development phase is a valid method to verify \\ncompleteness and correctness of safety mechanism implementation with respect to hardware safety \\nrequirements.

Other analogue safety mechanisms control or suppress a \\nfault from resulting in the violation of a safety requirement and do not interface with the digital domain.\\nTo comply with ISO 26262-5:2018, 8.4.8, the safety mechanisms described in the following tables can \\nrequire additional measures to detect faults affecting them that, as dual-point faults, can lead to the \\nviolation of the safety goal.\\nThe examples given in Table 37 to Table 40 are not exhaustive and other techniques can be used.\\nNOTE 1 \\nIt is not possible to give a general guidance on the DC because it strongly depends on the specific \\ntechnology, type of circuit, use case etc.\\nNOTE 2 \\nEvidence is provided to support the claimed diagnostic coverage.\\nTable 37 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Power supply\\nSafety mechanism/ \\nmeasure\\nSee overview of \\ntechniques\\nNotes\\nOver and under voltage \\nmonitoring\\n5.2.4.2\\nTypically an analogue circuit with an output latched in a digital core.\\nVoltage clamp (limiter)\\n5.2.4.3\\nTypically used to suppress voltage transients or spikes.\\nOver-current monitoring\\n5.2.4.4\\nTypically an analogue circuit with an output latched in digital core.\\nCurrent limiting\\n5.2.4.5\\nTypically an analogue circuit with feedback to an analogue control \\nloop (e.g. to disable regulator main pass element).\\nPower on reset\\n5.2.4.6\\nFunctional block which keeps the circuit in a known initialized \\nstate until power supply rails and/or the clock signal are stable.\\nTable 38 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Analogue I/O\\nSafety mechanism/ \\nmeasure\\nSee overview of \\ntechniques\\nNotes\\nResistive pull up/down\\n5.2.4.1\\nTypically used on input signals to avoid floating conditions due to \\npin failure or external pin interconnect failure.\\nFilter\\n5.2.4.8\\nAnalogue or digital circuit, typically used to suppress high frequency \\nsignal variation, like an output from analogue over & under voltage \\nmonitoring circuit.\\n \\n94 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

Commonly \\nused on I/O pins.\\nEXAMPLE \\nAn un-driven or disconnected device/module input pin would be at an unknown voltage level. \\nA pull-up resistor to the I/O supply voltage (or module supply voltage) or pull-down resistor to ground is used \\nto keep the input at a known voltage level. The circuit itself could be a passive resistor or an active circuit like a \\ncurrent mirror.\\n5.2.4.2 \\nOver & under voltage monitoring\\nAim: To detect, as early as possible, when a regulated voltage is outside the specified range.\\nDescription: The regulated voltage is compared via a differential input pair to a low and/or a high \\nanalogue reference voltage representing the limits of the specified operating range. The monitor output \\nwill change state when the regulated voltage is outside of the defined voltage window indicating a fault.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA window comparator is used to monitor the output of a Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator with \\nreference voltages set to the minimum and maximum specified voltage levels in regulation.\\n5.2.4.3 \\nVoltage clamp (limiter)\\nAim: To prevent the voltage of a circuit node from exceeding the maximum voltage that can be safely \\nsupported.\\nDescription: A voltage clamp limits the positive and/or negative voltage of a circuit node to an \\nacceptable level determined by system and/or device process capability. Voltage clamps can be biased \\nor unbiased.

Voltage clamps are typically used to protect against transient events.\\nEXAMPLE \\nAn ESD protection circuit is a specialized voltage clamp typically implemented on I/O pins. It is \\ndesigned to shunt the energy of a high voltage electrostatic discharge on the I/O pins away from the internal \\ncircuitry to ensure that internal circuitry is not exposed to excessive voltage levels during the ESD event.\\n5.2.4.4 \\nOver-current monitoring\\nAim: To detect, as early as possible, when the output current exceeds a certain value.\\nDescription: The implementation of over-current monitoring can vary. A typical approach for a voltage \\nregulator circuit with an MOS output device is to add a sense FET in parallel with a regulator main FET. \\nThe sense FET current, which is proportional to the main FET current, flows across a sense resistor. \\nThe voltage drop across the sense resistor is amplified and monitored by a voltage monitor.\\nNOTE \\nThe output of an over-current monitor is a digital output which is subsequently used as feedback to \\nan analogue circuit control loop, and/or latched in a digital core which interfaces to the control and/or status \\nmonitoring circuits.\\n5.2.4.5 \\nCurrent limiter\\nAim: To limit output current to a maximum level in order to maintain a safe operating area of the output \\ndevice and prevent electrical overstress.\\nDescription: A closed loop system using negative feedback from a current monitor to reduce the drive \\nto the output device thereby limiting the output current.\\n5.2.4.6 \\nPower on reset\\nAim: To hold the outputs of a system in a known state (typically off) until internal nodes have stabilized \\nupon power up or power reset conditions.\\nDescription: Typically, a bandgap-derived voltage reference is compared to an attenuated supply \\nvoltage in order to detect the minimum specified supply voltage which will ensure correct operation. \\nHysteresis is typically required to prevent oscillation as the attenuated supply voltage exceeds the \\nreference voltage.\\nEXAMPLE \\nAn under-voltage monitor is a mechanism used to detect and drive power-on reset.\\n5.2.4.7 \\nAnalogue watchdog\\nAim: To monitor proper operation of an oscillator.\\nDescription: Typically implemented with a monostable circuit (one shot) which is reset on each cycle \\nof the oscillator. If an oscillator transition does not occur within a specified time period defined by the \\nmonostable circuit, a fault signal is produced.\\n5.2.4.8 \\nFilter\\nAim: To avoid transients potentially causing failures:\\nDescription: A filter can be used in multiple ways as a safety mechanism.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nA bypass capacitor can be used to suppress voltage transients. An RC time constant is used to \\nevaluate whether the duration of a fault which has the potential to violate the safety goal is within the maximum \\nfault handling time interval.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nA digital de-glitch circuit can be used to filter level shifted analogue voltage comparator outputs.\\n \\n96 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\n5.2.4.9 \\nThermal monitor\\nAim: To detect when circuit temperature exceeds a specified limit.\\nDescription: Typically, a PTAT (proportional to absolute temperature) voltage is compared to a \\ntemperature independent reference voltage usually derived from a bandgap. The comparator will \\ngenerate a fault signal when the PTAT voltage exceeds the reference voltage.\\n5.2.4.10 Analogue Built-in Self-Test (Analogue BIST)\\nAim: Typically, to verify correct operation of diagnostic circuits and increase the detection of latent faults.\\nDescription: The implementation of analogue BIST varies according to the diagnostic function to be \\nverified. Analogue BIST typically involves exercising diagnostic circuits into and out of fault scenarios \\nby injecting currents or voltages into the diagnostic circuit to ensure the diagnostic circuit can switch \\nto both faulted and non-faulted states.\\n5.2.4.11 ADC monitoring\\nAim: To measure an analogue signal by means of digital conversion with an output processed/evaluated \\nin the digital core as an independent/ redundant analogue signal monitor.\\nDescription: A critical analogue signal for which accuracy is relevant is converted in a digital code by \\nmeans of an independent ADC (e.g. located outside the component or, at least biased by an independent \\nsource). The digital code is then processed by the CPU or an equivalent digital machine in order \\nto determine if the original analogue signal has the required performance in terms of accuracy and \\nstatic and dynamic behaviour. The frequency of the sampling and the resolution of the ADC and digital \\nprocessing define which failure modes can be detected and to what accuracy.\\n5.2.4.12 ADC attenuation detection\\nAim: To detect incorrect conversion of an analogue signal into its digital interpretation.\\nDescription: Upon each background conversion loop, the element performs the conversion of the internal \\nVmid voltage both with and without the selectable attenuation switched in. The conversion results are \\nstored respectively in separate SPI fields. A mathematical operation of dividing the attenuated result by \\nthe non-attenuated result verifies that the attenuation factor is within specified limits.\\n5.2.4.13 Stuck on ADC channel detection\\nAim: To detect stuck on faults affecting the input signal to be converted by the ADC\\nDescription: The element provides a multiplexer channel with series resistor RPOST, which is selected \\nonly when converting the test voltage channels (Vhigh, Vlow, Vmid), and RPOST is otherwise bypassed. \\nThe value of RPOST is chosen such that a stuck-on channel within the post-buffer mux pulls one or more \\nof the test voltage channels out of the expected voltage range.\\nEXAMPLE \\nEach software loop, the MCU reads the ADC conversion results for the Vhigh, Vlow and Vmid \\ncomponent ADC channels over SPI, and compares them against fixed detection thresholds.\\n5.2.5 \\nAvoidance of systematic faults during the development phase\\nAnalogue and mixed signal components are developed based on a standardised development process.\\nThe general requirements and recommendations related to hardware architecture and detailed design \\nare defined in ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 7.\\nThe guidance in 5.1.9 can be applied to the analogue and mixed signal components if:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nTable 31 is replaced by Table 41; and\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n97\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

Signal routing capabilities can range from simple point-to-point solutions, to complex \\nbus interconnects with flexible routing possibilities and clocking options. PLDs can differ in their \\nimplementation of user memory. Some devices provide limited memory capabilities, whilst others \\nprovide local or global memory structures that can be used for a wide variety of applications. The \\nmore complex devices can also implement fixed functions such as CPUs, memory controllers, security \\nmodules, and others, thus freeing up design resources for user configurability. Clock, power and reset \\ncircuitries are fixed functions. It is up to the PLD design if single or multiple instances are implemented.\\nA common feature of PLDs is that users can configure them with the functionality adapted to the \\nspecific application needs. The design or configuration of the devices can be done with a variety of \\ntools, ranging from the very simple to entire development suites supporting complex features such as \\ntiming analysis and optimization of the design. Once the user design is completed it can be programmed \\ninto the device. Different technologies support either one time programmability or the reprogramming \\nof the device multiple times.

      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nThe following clauses give examples with respect to some specific part of the ISO 26262 series of \\nstandards for either PLD manufacturers or PLD users.\\n5.3.1.3.2 \\nISO 26262-2 (management of functional safety)\\nIn general, ISO 26262-2 adapted to the appropriate level is applicable for the PLD manufacturer and the \\nPLD user.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.2.1 requires that a project manager is appointed at the initiation of the item \\ndevelopment. For a PLD manufacturer it means that a project manager is appointed at the initiation of the PLD \\ndevelopment.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nAccording to ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.6.5 the safety plan includes item level planning such as the \\nplanning of the hazard analysis and risk assessment as given in ISO 26262-3 [64], Clause 6. Since the hazard analysis \\nand risk assessment is done on item level only this requirement is not applicable for a safety plan on PLD level.\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.11 requires a functional safety audit to be carried out for the item. Since \\nit is not possible for the PLD manufacturer to carry out a safety audit on item level, it is handled on PLD level \\ninstead.\\nEXAMPLE 4 \\nISO 26262-2:2018, 7.4.2.1 requires the organization to appoint persons with the responsibility and \\nthe corresponding authority, as given in ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.4.2.7, to maintain the functional safety of the item \\nafter its release for production. For a PLD manufacturer this means that a person is appointed for maintaining \\nthe functional safety of the PLD after its release for production, instead of being responsible for maintaining the \\nfunctional safety of the whole item.\\n5.3.1.3.3 \\nISO 26262-3 (concept phase)\\nWith respect to ISO 26262-3, the PLD manufacturer usually does not have any responsibility during the \\nconcept phase, unless the PLD manufacturer also assumes the role of item integrator. If the PLD user is \\nresponsible on item level, this part is applicable.\\n5.3.1.3.4 \\nISO 26262-4 (product development at the system level)\\nA PLD can be developed as an SEooC. For an SEooC development, ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 6 and \\nISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 7 are partially or fully in scope. Guidelines for SEooC development can be \\nfound in ISO 26262-10 [61].\\nEXAMPLE \\nDedicated hardware safety measures can be implemented on the PLD by the PLD manufacturer \\nto support the technical safety concept. Other measures can depend on the implemented user circuitry and can \\nrequire specific measures (e.g. redundancy in logic, external watchdog) and are the responsibility of the user. \\nThe assumptions made by the PLD manufacturer on the system level measures are documented and verified by \\nthe PLD user.\\nIf the PLD user is also the item integrator, ISO 26262-4 is fully in scope.\\n5.3.1.3.5 \\nISO 26262-5 (product development at the hardware level)\\nAll the ISO 26262-5 clauses, including ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 8 and ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 9, are \\napplicable to PLD manufacturers and PLD users according to their level of contribution to the overall \\nsafety concept.\\nEXAMPLE \\nIf the PLD does not include any hardware safety mechanisms, the main role of PLD manufacturer \\nis to provide base failure rate, failure modes, and failure modes distribution using, for example, the methods \\ndescribed in 4.6 of this document. A reference or exemplary computation of hardware architectural metrics can \\nbe provided but the PLD user computes the metrics for the specific design to be implemented in the PLD.\\nWith respect to ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 8 and ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 9, the responsibility of PLD \\nmanufacturers is generally related to providing the information, methods and/or tools needed to enable \\nPLD users to compute and verify the metrics, including:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nthe distribution of failure modes; and\\n \\n104 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

Further information on \\ndiagnostic coverage is provided in 5.3.4.\\n5.3.1.3.6 \\nISO 26262-6 (product development at the software level)\\nBased on ISO 26262-4:2018, 6.4.6.5, requirements of ISO 26262-5 and ISO 26262-6 can be combined for \\nprogrammable logic like PLDs.\\nIn the case of a high-level synthesis flow, like developing in OpenCL, C-to-HDL flows, or a model based \\napproach, interactions with the requirements of ISO 26262-6 are relevant for the development of the \\nhigh level language code. ISO 26262-5 is relevant for the subsequent steps used for traditional PLD \\ndevelopment.\\nIf the development flow for PLD users and PLD manufacturers is based on HDL languages, this is similar to \\nthe one used to develop microcontrollers, so ISO 26262-5 applies. ISO 26262-6 is not relevant in this case.\\nNOTE \\nSpecific techniques and measures for user PLD circuit development are discussed in 5.3.5.3. For \\nmany methods there are similarities with respect to what is specified in ISO 26262-6, e.g. observation of coding \\nguidelines.\\n5.3.1.3.7 \\nISO 26262-7 (production and operation)\\nIn general ISO 26262-7 adapted to the appropriate level is applicable for the PLD manufacturer. This \\nalso applies to the PLD user when involved in the production of a hardware element of the item or of the \\nitem itself.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nIn ISO 26262-7:2018, 5.4.1.1 the requirement is to plan the production process by evaluating the \\nitem. In the context of the PLD manufacturer the planning is done by evaluating the PLD instead of the item.\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nISO 26262-7:2018, 5.4.1.4 requires the identification of reasonably foreseeable process failures \\nand their effect on functional safety and to implement appropriate measure to address these issues. It is \\napplicable to a PLD production without modification.\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nISO 26262-7:2018, 5.4.3.5 requirements for decommissioning instructions are typically not \\napplicable to PLDs\\nEXAMPLE 4 \\nTo comply with ISO 26262-7:2018, 7.4.1.1 the PLD manufacturer implements a field monitoring \\nprocess for the PLD.\\n5.3.2 \\nFailure modes of PLD\\nIn line with the lifecycle shown in 5.3.1.3, Table 43 summarises the failure modes that can be of concern \\nfor PLD users. Failure modes for PLD can be derived by applying key words as mentioned in 4.3.2.\\nNOTE \\nThe listings do not claim exhaustiveness and can be adjusted based on additional known failure modes.\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n105\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

In the further development steps this requirement is allocated to software \\nelement software_mon.1 with an ASIL Y(X) and to software element software_mon.2 with an ASIL Z(X). A DFA \\nhas shown that issues with the shared resources (cores, RAM and a software driver \"software peripheral\" \\nforwarding the sensor values to software_mon.1 and software_mon.2) can threaten the independence \\nrequirement, i.e. causing memory, time, execution or exchange of information interferences between software_\\nmon.1 and software_mon.2. In this example the shared core issue is addressed by mapping software_mon.1 \\nand software_mon.2 to two different PEs, therefore un-sharing the cores. The memory interference aspect is \\naddressed by memory encapsulation via a MPU which is configured by the OS. Since in this case the OS is a safety \\nmechanism ensuring the independence between software_mon.1 and software_mon.2 it is developed compliant \\nwith ASIL X. The issue with the shared software resource \"software peripheral\" is addressed by developing it \\ncompliant with the initial ASIL, i.e. ASIL X.\\nWith respect to interference against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime and execution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d entries of ISO 26262-6:2018, D.2.2, the \\nprimary case to consider is interference that affects the execution latency or correct programming \\nsequence of one core.\\nEXAMPLE 5 \\nA CAN peripheral is used by more than one core to exchange information with other ECUs.

Automatic gain control (AGC) allows for the gain of transducer amplification to \\nbe adjusted based on the amplitude of the transducer output signal. At low transducer output levels, \\nthe gain is increased and at higher transducer output levels, the gain is decreased to allow for greater \\ndynamic range.\\n5.5.4.6 \\nSensitivity adjustment\\nAim: \\nTo maintain sensitivity within its specified range\\nDescription: The sensitivity of a sensor/transducer is within its specified range over the operating \\ntemperature range of the sensor in order to ensure an accurate output. There are various methods to \\nadjust the sensitivity of a transducer in order to account for environmental fluctuations.\\nEXAMPLE 1 \\nThe use of a micro-heater activated by current to maintain sensitivity of MEMS parts over \\ntemperature [46].\\nEXAMPLE 2 \\nThe modification of bias current through a hall cell to maintain sensitivity over temperature.\\nEXAMPLE 3 \\nThe application of an electrostatic potential to MEMS fingers which electrically dampens \\nmovement and decreases sensitivity when applied.\\nEXAMPLE 4 \\nThe component connected to the MEMS has a built-in temperature sensor.

For example, additional mechanical or \\noptical mechanisms (e.g. References [44] and [45]) can be used within the transducer as safety \\nmechanisms such as a simple stop or floating cantilevered finger.\\nThese simple mechanical mechanisms can optionally include a separate signal output to allow the \\ntransducer to enter a safe state upon detection of a failure mode thereby eliminating the transducer \\nas the DFI of a specific safety goal or hardware requirement in a system. This would be in addition to \\nany dedicated measures or traditional E/E safety mechanisms and could potentially provide coverage \\nagainst both random and systematic faults within the transducer.\\nSuch non-E/E safety mechanisms could be defined in the application of diagnostic coverage. The level \\nof diagnostic coverage afforded by a non-E/E safety mechanism for a specific use case would require \\nsound engineering evaluation by domain experts to derive the proper value with each rationale and \\nverification activity fully documented and included in the safety case.

The Signal S1 is an \\nanalogue signal that indicates the state of an actuator. The requirement is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn unintended state shall be \\nrecognized and shall lead to the de-activation of the actuator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This is considered to be the safe state. \\nFor that purpose, the Signal S1 is converted into digital information and then processed by a software \\nelement software1 to identify a possible hazardous state of the actuator. The software element \\nsoftware2 is responsible to redundantly acquire information from Hardware Element 1.1 and 1.2. The \\nmain task of software2 is to control the DMA to fetch the conversion results from Hardware Element \\n1.1 and 1.2 and store as separated data sets in a shared buffer located in Data SRAM. DMA informs \\nsoftware2 about the completion of transfers by sending an interrupt to the ICU. Upon reception of \\nthis event software2 compares the plausibility of the data sets and in the case of mismatch it provides \\npredefined error information to software1.

The analysis will follow the proposed workflow. To simplify the analysis, each step will \\nnot be considered. With respect to the requirements MCU-REQ-2, this step focuses on analysing the \\narchitecture focusing on steps B1 and B2 of the DFA workflow. The analysis is supported by a qualitative \\nfault tree (see Figure B.2) that identifies the shared resources and the redundant elements.\\nFigure B.2 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Shared elements overview\\nFor the shared resources, each failure base event or AND gate is analysed on its own. For the CPU \\nand Redundant CPU a base event Dependent Failures has already been introduced because the safety \\nmechanism is already visible on the proposed architectural level. It is recommended to analyse the \\nGeneric Infrastructure Elements that have a global effect separately, in order to avoid considering \\nthem for each shared element independently. This is possible for the power supply and clock generation \\nbecause they have their own safety mechanisms. However, for the Reset Generation, Test Signals and \\nDebug Infrastructure it is necessary to analyse them at a lower level where their influence on the shared \\nelements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 safety mechanisms can be analysed.

In order to avoid that faults of a switch transistor or its \\ngate driver can activate the actuator inadvertently, the switches are redundantly placed in the high side \\nand low side current paths to the load. The high side and low side drivers are supplied by a regulated \\nVreg Vdd which is significantly lower than the external supply Vbat coming from the board net connected \\nto the 12 V battery of the vehicle. The output of the supply voltage regulator is already monitored by a \\nvoltage monitor which is used for non-safety purposes like the provision of a power on reset. The gate \\nvoltage that is needed to turn on the high side N-DMOS switch transistor is delivered by a charge pump \\nin order to make the driver insensitive to EMC on the board net.\\nFigure B.4 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Analogue output driver example\\nIn order to be able to identify dependent failure mechanisms, the following safety requirement is assumed: \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the inactive state, the load connected between the high side switch transistor output and low side \\nswitch transistor output shall not be supplied with a current of more than 1 mA for longer than 1 ms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nNOTE \\nThe current of 1 mA is assumed to be much lower than the current that is drawn by the load in the \\ncase that the switches are turned on (e.g. 1 A).\\nB.2.2 Dependent failures by shared supply voltage regulator\\nThe primary fault that leads to the exemplary dependent failures is illustrated in Figure B.5. The supply \\nvoltage regulator, that supplies the internal driver circuitry for the control of the switch transistor \\ngate voltages, fails in a way that the pass device (pass device is the transistor that is in the supply \\ncurrent path) is permanently turned on. The fault mechanism could be a defect of the pass transistor \\nitself or a fault of the control loop that causes instability like e.g. loss of a compensation capacitor. The \\nconsequence is a rise of the internal supply level Vdd to the external supply level Vbat.\\n \\n142 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

The first one is a fault induced in the charge pump, which is shown as a dotted line in \\nthe block diagram. In the worst case this fault can have the same effect than a damage of the high side driver due \\nto overvoltage at its Vdd supply input and is therefore already included in the way the Vdd supply overvoltage fault \\nwas introduced in the FTA (see Figure B.6). Another dependent failure that could be induced by the overvoltage \\nis the damage of the voltage monitor which can cause that the overvoltage stays undetected; this will be handled \\nlater on in the discussion of the measures to mitigate the dependent failures of the gate drivers.\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n143\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

For this \\ncase the new freedom from interference requirement could be formulated as follows: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA failure of the \\nsupply voltage regulator that shorts the internal supply Vdd to the external supply voltage Vbat shall not \\ncause a failure in the voltage monitor or a failure of the pull down blocks, which disables the pull down \\ncurrent paths in a way that the threshold of the switch transistors can be exceeded longer than 1 ms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor the achievement of this new freedom from interference requirement additional safety measures are \\ninstalled for the switch transistors. These pull down blocks are not affected by the initial fault (short of \\nthe internal supply Vdd to the external board net supply Vbat) in a way that prevents them from keeping \\nthe gates of the output switch transistor pulled down.\\nExample of taken measures:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 introduction of a high voltage protection block for the supply monitor (a); and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 design of the gate pull down dimensioned for operation at the external supply voltage (b).\\nFor this example it is assumed that the IC technology allows to implement these measures in a way that \\nprovides sufficient safety margin.

They can vary from architecture to architecture.\\nNOTE 2 \\nThe following examples divide a portion of the digital component into the subparts level. As discussed \\nin 5.1.7, the necessary level of detail can depend on the stage of the analysis and on the safety mechanisms used.\\nNOTE 3 \\nThe following examples use the quantitative approach to compute a dedicated target \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle-\\npoint fault metric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d value for transient faults. As discussed in 5.1.7.2, transient faults can be also addressed by \\nqualitative rationale. The rationale includes the reason why the qualitative approach is adequate.\\nThe example considers a small portion of a digital component, i.e. only two parts:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\na small CPU, divided in five subparts: register bank, ALU, load-store unit, control logic and debug. \\nEach subpart is further divided in several subparts; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\n16 KB of RAM divided in three subparts: cell array, address decoder and logic for end-of-line test, \\nand management of spare rows (redundancies) of RAM.\\nNOTE 4 \\nThe FIT numbers shown in the example do not include peripherals or other features such as package, \\nhandling or overstress. They are given just as an example of a possible method for FIT rate computation. For this \\nreason, those values are not comparable with FIT rates of a complete packaged digital component as shown for \\nexample in SN 29500.\\nNOTE 5 \\nThe aim of the following example is to avoid a requirement that each smallest digital component \\nsubpart be addressed in the system-level analysis. At system-level analysis, component or part level detail can \\nbe sufficient. The aim of this example is to provide evidence that for a digital component at stand-alone level, a \\ndeeper analysis (e.g. at subpart level) can be needed in order to compute with the required accuracy the failure \\nrates and failure mode coverage of parts and subparts, to be used afterwards by system engineers. In other \\nwords, without an accurate and detailed digital component stand-alone level analysis, it can be very difficult to \\nhave good data for system-level analysis.\\nThe following four safety mechanisms are considered:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\na hardware safety mechanism (SM1) performing logical monitoring of the program sequence of the \\nCPU.

The external system is responsible for fault \\nreaction including transitioning the system or element to a safe state.\\nThe example of quantitative analysis limited to permanent faults is reported in Table D.5 using the \\nsame format as Figure C.1. The safety mechanisms considered in the analysis are:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nthe voltage monitor detecting overvoltage (safety mechanism SM2) and under-voltage (safety \\nmechanism SM1) failures;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nthe independent ADC channel detecting variation of the regulated voltage higher than \\xe2\\x88\\x86\\xc2\\xa0= 5mV \\n(safety mechanism SM3). The safety mechanism is described in 5.2.4.11;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\na current limiter detecting failures affecting circuits supplied by the low drop voltage regulator \\n(safety mechanism SM5). The safety mechanism is described in 5.2.4.5; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nan analogue BIST detecting failures affecting the voltage monitor.\\nNOTE 8 \\nEvidence is provided to show the independence of the current limiter with respect to the regulator core.\\nNOTE 9 \\nThe ADC used as safety mechanism SM3 is assumed to be external to the hardware element under \\nanalysis and so it is not considered in the FMEA. There is an ADC included in the hardware element which is not \\nSM3: It is therefore reported in the FMEA as not safety-related.\\nThe coverage levels claimed by the safety mechanisms are reported in Table D.4.\\nTable D.4 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Safety mechanisms considered in the example with the new safety requirement\\nID\\nSafety mechanism\\nClaimed failure mode coverage\\nSM1\\nUnder-voltage (UV) Monitor\\n99,9 %\\nSM2\\nOver-voltage (OV) Monitor\\n99,9 %\\nSM3\\nIndependent ADC monitoring\\n97 %\\nSM5\\nCurrent limiter\\n98 %\\nSM6\\nAnalogue BIST diagnostics\\n90 %\\nNOTE 10 The effectiveness of safety mechanisms could be affected by dependent failures. Adequate measures \\nare considered as described in 5.2.3.6.\\nMoreover, each safety mechanism signals the detection of a fault to an external element of the system/\\nitem which is then responsible to transition the system or element to a safe state.\\nUnder this assumption, the failure mode coverage with respect to latent failures related to the mission \\ncircuit is claimed to be 100 % according to ISO 26262-5:2018, Annex E.\\nTable D.5 shows the quantitative analysis for the mission part conducted at a finer level of granularity \\nthan the one in Table D.2 and Table D.3. The examples show that a different safety requirement impacts \\nthe level of partitioning and the diagnostic coverage requirement for one or more safety mechanisms.\\nNOTE 11 In this example the analysis with respect to transient faults is not reported but it can be added when \\nrelevant.\\n \\n162 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",

The system is intended for a safety-\\nrelated application where two microcontrollers are used for redundancy and the final control output \\nis implemented using a PLD. The two microcontrollers send their values to the PLD via SPI (Serial \\nPeripheral Interface) and the PLD communicates via CAN (Controller Area Network) bus. For this \\nexample, it is assumed that a calculated output too high (i.e. greater than the value that would have \\nbeen determined by a non-faulted system plus a threshold) is a potential hazard but an output too low is \\nacceptable from a functional safety point-of-view. It is also assumed that the components receiving the \\nCAN message can detect the loss of CAN messages and take appropriate action such as defaulting the \\nreceive signal to its minimum value and that the receiving module can tolerate corrupt CAN messages \\n(i.e. values higher than intended) for X number of messages.\\nFigure E.1 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Example of PLD usage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 output switch\\nNOTE \\nThe hardware component \\xe2\\x80\\x9cController\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is implemented using two microcontrollers and one PLD.\\nDerived safety requirements for hardware \\xe2\\x80\\x9cController\\xe2\\x80\\x9d:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nSafReq_hardware_Comp_Controller_001: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe output of a wrong value which is larger than the \\ncorrect value plus a threshold for X number of messages in-a-row shall be avoided\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x95 \\nSafReq_hardware_Comp_Controller_002: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUndetected lack of CAN outputs for longer than y ms \\nshall be avoided\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nThe hardware component \\xe2\\x80\\x9cController\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is implemented using two microcontrollers (\\xc2\\xb5Controller1 and \\n\\xc2\\xb5Controller2) and one PLD.

The safety analysis and the dependent failure analysis concerning \\n\\xc2\\xb5Controller1 and \\xc2\\xb5Controller2 are out of scope of this document.\\nFailures of the PLD can be addressed by two approaches:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 utilizing safety measures which are external to the PLD, or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 utilizing safety measures which are internal to the PLD. The PLD includes diagnostic measures to \\ndetect faults of the PLD.

The CAN output of the PLD is read back by \\n\\xc2\\xb5Controller1. \\xc2\\xb5Controller1 checks if the PLD has output a value equal or less than its output.

The internal \\narchitecture of the PLD is presented in Figure E.2. The data sent from the \\xc2\\xb5Controller is buffered before \\nit can be transferred via the CAN bus. The buffers are implemented as user memory, whereas the state \\nmachine controlling the buffer operation and the multiplexer are implemented by logic blocks and the \\nCAN module is a fixed function IP. The functionality of the logic blocks and the routing between the \\nblocks and memory are controlled by the configuration technology. For simplicity, the switch control \\nlogic, which determines whether data from Buffer 1 or Buffer 2 is sent, is not covered in this example.\\nThe design is also susceptible to intermittent and permanent hardware failures. Any chip infrastructure \\nsuch as clock or power could be a source of a common mode failure. These failures can be addressed by \\nredundancy with detection and reporting for single mode failures. Other examples include incorrect \\nload of code at initialization and bit flip in memory. These could be detected using checksums and \\nparity; however, some of these failures could result in a possible violation of the safety goal and would be \\nan unacceptable risk. Error-detection-correction codes (ECC) are a superior technique as they correct \\nerrors and could report after correction that a potential problem exists in the chip. Single failures in the \\nI/O of the chip only impact one output and represent less risk.\\nNOTE 1 \\nDepending on the functionality of the implemented circuitry it is necessary to perform further \\nactivities besides correcting the fault to restore the functionality of the design (e.g. a fault in the configuration \\ntechnology leads to a non-recoverable state of a state-machine, even though the fault in the configuration \\ntechnology was corrected).\\n \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved \\n171\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
      "b' \\nISO 26262-11:2018(E)\\nFigure E.2 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 PLD architecture\\nIf the fault has the potential to violate the safety goal without being detected by the internal safety \\nmechanisms it is detected by \\xc2\\xb5Controller1 through loss of the CAN signal or a mismatch between its \\nSPI output and the CAN read. This is acceptable if \\xc2\\xb5Controller1 can disable the PLD via the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDisable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nsignal. A dependent failures analysis is done to ensure that the risk of the PLD violating a safety goal in \\ncombination with the failure of the deactivation via the disable signal is sufficiently low.\\nEXAMPLE \\nA potential hazard could occur if the switch is unable to respond to the disable command from \\n\\xc2\\xb5Controller1. This would be a multiple-point fault situation as if both \\xc2\\xb5Controller1 and 2 were good, the PLD \\noutput would still represent safe values. There would not be a potential risk until one of the \\xc2\\xb5Controllers fails \\nand the PLD responds incorrectly. To detect this multiple-point fault, a periodic test of the disable logic can be \\nimplemented. Since this would be performed at system or element level, the specific details are out of scope of \\nthis document and are not described further.\\nNOTE 2 \\nIn this simple example, the external measures can replace the internal safety mechanisms. In general, \\ncases exist in which the internal measures are necessary to reach target diagnostic coverage and therefore the \\ndetailed analysis of internal safety mechanisms described in this sub-clause is applied.\\nRandom hardware faults can be analysed by applying an inductive fault analysis (e.g. FMEA) on the \\ndesign. Faults of the user design, but also faults of the PLD technology are taken into account and \\nconsider permanent and transient faults. The qualitative analysis of the design is followed up with a \\nquantitative analysis, similar to the one described in Annex C of this document.\\nAs described in 5.3.3.1, inputs to the quantitative analysis can be made available by the PLD \\nmanufacturer with regard to the failure rates of the elementary subparts of the PLD and the failure \\nmode distribution.\\nNOTE 3 \\nIn this case of PLD internal measures, for failure mode distribution determination the approaches as \\ndescribed in 5.3.3.1.3 b) or c) are preferable.\\nTable E.2 provides a framework for a quantitative analysis of the above design, which can be augmented \\nwith information similar to Figure C.1.\\nNOTE 4 \\nAs discussed in 5.1.7, the necessary level of detail can depend on the stage of the analysis and on the \\nsafety mechanisms used.\\n \\n172 \\n\\xc2\\xa9 ISO 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 All rights reserved\\nNormen-Download-Beuth-Lisa Dr\\xc3\\xa4xlmaier GmbH-KdNr.280437-ID.QTQDJF4FTSNOCAQV92E2EK5D.1-2019-01-23 11:03:40\\n'\n",
