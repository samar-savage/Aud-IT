      "Introduction\n",
      "The ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the \n",
      "sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles.\n",
      "This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised \n",
      "of electrical, electronic and software components.\n",
      "Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of \n",
      "automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence \n",
      "that functional safety objectives are satisfied.\n",
      "With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic \n",
      "implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, \n",
      "these being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes \n",
      "guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes. \n",
      "To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:\n",
      "a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities \n",
      "to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and \n",
      "decommissioning;\n",
      "b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive \n",
      "Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];\n",
      "c) \n",
      "uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable \n",
      "residual risk;\n",
      "d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, \n",
      "validation and confirmation measures; and\n",
      "e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.\n",
      "The ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved \n",
      "through safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which \n",
      "safety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be \n",
      "considered.\n",
      "The achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such \n",
      "activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation \n",
      "and configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.\n",
      "Safety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work \n",
      "products. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and \n",
      "work products.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of \n",
      "standards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product \n",
      "development. Within the figure: \n",
      "— the shaded “V”s represent the interconnection among ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, \n",

      "— for motorcycles:\n",
      "— ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 supports ISO 26262-3;\n",
      "— ISO 26262-12:2018, Clauses 9 and 10 support ISO 26262-4; \n",
